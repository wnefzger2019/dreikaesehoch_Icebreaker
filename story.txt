Once upon a time, Team Dreikaesehoch was hanging out in the Biergarten.
They were sipping fine beers when suddenly a Hund came into view.
It was so scary that Jay dropped his Bratwurst.
He could not comprehend that this Hund wore a pair of lederhose.
Bill was afraid that other patrons would take brot.
The Hund was heading along the Hauptstrasse that led to the Eltz.
An Apfelkuchen was found on the Hauptstrasse which the Hund ate.
